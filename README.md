Building Minesweeper in Minesweeper, for SIGBOVIK 2025

To play the board yourself:
1. Go to https://davidnhill.github.io/JSMinesweeper
2. Disable the automatic solver, or your browser _will_ grind to a halt. To do this, set the "Overlay" dropdown to "None", the "Show hints" checkbox to off, and "Auto play" to off.
3. (technically optional) Turn "Fast mode" on. This will take some game actions for you, but just the boring ones that require only a single safe cell's information.
4. Drag minesweeper_in_minesweeper.mine onto the board.

How did I do this? The answers are in the pdf! I also wrote a few tiny scripts to copy/paste and rotate regions of the board, and a solver to determine where the hidden mines are.
